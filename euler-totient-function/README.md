# Euler's Totient function Numbers

## Description

This program calculates Euler's Totient function for a given number. Euler's Totient function, also known as Euler's phi function, counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to a given number that are coprime (relatively prime) to it.

The program uses a loop to iterate through the prime factors of the number. It applies the formula to calculate the totient function: $Ï†(n) = n * (1 - 1/p1) * (1 - 1/p2) * ... * (1 - 1/pk)$, where p1, p2, ..., pk are the distinct prime factors of n. The program updates the result by subtracting the result divided by each prime factor.
